# kit(Kubectl Interactive Tool)

Forked from kubectl on [commit b155278f1f](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubectl/tree/b155278f1f4a21a0be2d4f6f0037258dee4d1a22). On this fork, the *writing* commands(like `apply` `delete`) are changed to interactive mode. The k8s-events and effective activties inner k8s will display on the UI Window in real-time, which can help operator to monitor the progress after exec a *writing* comman.
